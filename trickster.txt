         Trickster challenge:

This is a python game!

We play a child, the goal is to dodge the reaper.

If the reaper touches the player, game is lost.

The flag is not in clear in the code, but we modify the game so we never collide with the reaper :)

After we deleted the collision code, we play long enough to dodge 100 times the reaper and get the flag:

$ python game.py
flag{CaNT_ch34t_d34th}
