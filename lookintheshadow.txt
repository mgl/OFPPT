Steganography challenge:

We download an image named LookInTheShadows.jpg

We use stegseek with the rockyou list to crack the data hidden in the image
https://github.com/RickdeJager/stegseek

$ stegseek LookInTheShadows.jpg ./rockyou.txt

We get the filename:
    [i] Found passphrase: ""
    [i] Found original filename: "secret.txt"
    [i] Extracting to "LookInTheShadows.jpg.out"

The secret.txt file contains "OFPPT-CTF{3mb3dd3d_H1dd3n_73x7_d4t4}"

Flag: OFPPT-CTF{3mb3dd3d_H1dd3n_73x7_d4t4}
