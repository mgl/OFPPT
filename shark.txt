Shark challenge

We have to find the flag inside the pcap file.

We get an archive named capture.zip but it's password protected.

We try to bruteforce it and it turns out the password is empty ^^

When unzipped we get the capture.pcapng file.

We open it with Wireshark https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

There are too many network requests like ACK so we filter the HTTP traffic.

Most of the traffic is encrypted.

We find a plain html page (text/html) but it doesnt contain the flag.

We use Wireshark to follow the TCP stream and get all the requests before.

In one of the HTTP requests we find what looks like a flag.

It looks like a cesar cipher!

We apply a reverse ROT13 16 times and tada:

Flag: OFPPT-CTF{4lw4ys_F0110w_th3_str34m}
